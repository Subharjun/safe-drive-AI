## PART 1: INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
**[0:00 - 0:30]**

Hello! I'm presenting Safe Drive AI, an intelligent driver wellness monitoring system. Did you know drowsy driving causes over 100,000 crashes annually? Our solution uses artificial intelligence and blockchain to detect driver fatigue in real-time and prevent accidents before they happen. We combine computer vision, machine learning, and EVM-compatible smart contracts to create a comprehensive safety platform. Let's see how it works.

## PART 2: TECHNOLOGY STACK (30 seconds)
**[0:30 - 1:00]**

Our tech stack is powerful yet efficient. Frontend uses Next.js with TypeScript and real-time React dashboards. Backend runs Python FastAPI with TensorFlow and MediaPipe for facial analysis. We integrate Groq's LLaMA 3 for AI recommendations. Data persists in MongoDB Atlas for scalability. Blockchain integration uses Celo, an EVM-compatible chain, ensuring transparent safety records. Everything works together seamlessly for real-time driver monitoring.

## PART 3: NAVIGATION & ROUTES (30 seconds)
**[1:00 - 1:30]**

Starting with Navigation and Routes. Drivers plan journeys using OpenRouteService API for optimal routing. The system identifies safe stopping points along your route - rest areas, gas stations, and emergency locations. The interactive map shows color-coded safety zones with green markers for recommended breaks. Route optimization considers real-time traffic and road conditions, ensuring you reach your destination safely and efficiently.

## PART 4: LIVE MONITORING (30 seconds)
**[1:30 - 2:00]**

Now the core feature - Live Monitor. Watch as AI analyzes facial features in real-time using advanced computer vision. The system detects eye closure patterns, yawning frequency, and facial tension. Live metrics update every second showing drowsiness and stress levels. Color-coded alerts make it simple - green means alert, yellow indicates caution, red demands immediate rest. All data automatically saves to MongoDB for analysis.

## PART 5: WELLNESS ANALYTICS (30 seconds)
**[2:00 - 2:30]**

The Wellness Dashboard shows comprehensive analytics. Current metrics display overall wellness score, alertness percentage, and calmness level. Session statistics track your monitoring history and improvement trends. The AI recommendations section uses Groq's LLaMA 3 to analyze patterns and provide personalized advice. Detailed charts show wellness trends over time, helping drivers understand and improve their habits through data-driven insights.

## PART 6: SAFETY ALERTS (30 seconds)
**[2:30 - 3:00]**

Safety Alerts provide intelligent interventions. When AI detects dangerous conditions like high drowsiness or elevated stress, it triggers immediate alerts. Critical alerts suggest pulling over, warning alerts recommend breaks, and info alerts provide helpful tips. Each alert includes severity level, timestamp, and specific recommendations. This proactive approach prevents accidents before they happen, not after. Real-time protection for every journey.

## PART 7: BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION (30 seconds)
**[3:00 - 3:30]**

Our blockchain integration uses Celo, an EVM-compatible chain. Every monitoring session creates an immutable record on-chain. Drivers earn Safe Driving Tokens for maintaining good wellness scores, usable for rewards and insurance discounts. Driver Wellness NFTs serve as verifiable safety certificates. Smart contracts ensure transparency while maintaining privacy. This creates a portable safety reputation that follows drivers across jobs and platforms.

## PART 8: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (30 seconds)
**[3:30 - 4:00]**

Key technical achievements include sub-second AI processing latency using optimized TensorFlow models. MongoDB Atlas handles thousands of data points per session with automatic session grouping. FastAPI provides high-throughput endpoints that scale horizontally. We combine computer vision for detection, machine learning for patterns, and large language models for recommendations. Smart contracts on Celo ensure data integrity through cryptographic techniques. Enterprise-ready architecture.

## PART 9: IMPACT & VISION (30 seconds)
**[4:00 - 4:30]**

The impact extends beyond individual drivers. Transportation companies reduce accident rates and insurance costs. Insurance providers gain data-driven risk assessment. Drivers receive wellness support and professional development tools. Future plans include vehicle system integration for automatic interventions, predictive analytics to forecast fatigue, multi-driver fleet management, and expanded blockchain features for cross-platform safety reputation. Making roads safer for everyone.

## QUICK GENERATION WORKFLOW

1. **Copy each part** into your AI voice generator
2. **Generate audio** for each 30-second segment
3. **Download** as separate MP3 files (part1.mp3, part2.mp3, etc.)
4. **Combine** in video editor with corresponding screen recordings
5. **Add transitions** (1-2 seconds fade) between parts
6. **Export** final video

---

## ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE SCRIPT (5 minutes)

If you want ONE continuous script, concatenate all parts with 2-second pauses:

```
[PART 1] ... [2 sec pause] ... [PART 2] ... [2 sec pause] ... [PART 10]
```

Total time: ~5 minutes 20 seconds (including pauses)
